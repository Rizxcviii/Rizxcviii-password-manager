# Rizxcviii Password Manager

Welcome to my application, where you will be able to work with a password manager, that also works on generating useful passwords for the user, by answering questions, and then scrambling them.

## Running the app

Please perform the following script in the root directory in a terminal/command prompt. `npm install` followed by `npm run build`. This will install and build a working application for you to use. Once completed, please go to your browser (Google chrome), and turning on developer mdoe. If you are not sure how to do so, please follow the instructions on [this tutorial](https://webkul.com/blog/how-to-install-the-unpacked-extension-in-chrome/).

However, when asked to select a folder, please select the `bulid` folder in this directory, which contains optimised code for you to run your application with.
